# Projects
This projects contains 2 projects and the data files associates with them. They are as follows:

1.ML algorithm:

In this project a company employees data is taken as the input data as the file 'Absenteeism_.csv' in which the employees data with the absentees for the work is given. The attributes of the data set are the reasons of the employees to take leaves. The code is buit in such a way that the attributes of the employees are analysed and gives the report as a table showing how much each attribute effects the employee's leave taking chances(pobability). This analysis made through ML technique and by using logistic regression. The ML process includes standardisation, splitting the data into training and testing, building the model, training the model and giving the accurate and final results of the model(at accuracy more than 90%).

2.Data analysis:

It is a simple data analysis code in which KNN is used to classify the data points. In this 'iris_dataset.csv' file is given with the folwers data having count of sepals and petals and other properties of the iris flowers. Based on the properties of the flowers they are classified into 3 clusters by using KNN algorithm from sklearn module in python. The clusters are ploted at the end.
